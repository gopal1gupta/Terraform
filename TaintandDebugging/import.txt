Terraform can import existing infrastructure resources.
This functionality lets you bring existing resources under Terraform management.

Getting the pre-existing cloud resources under the Terraform management is facilitated by Terraform import.
import is a Terraform CLI command which is used to read real-world infrastructure and update the state,
so that future updates to the same set of infrastructure can be applied via IaC.

The import functionality helps update the state locally and it does not create the corresponding configuration
automatically. However, the Terraform team is working hard to improve this function in upcoming releases.

syntax:
terraform import <resource_type>.<resource_name> <attribute>
terraform import aws_instance.webserver instanceid

note when we run above command for the first time it will update the state file
but it will fail to create resource in configuration file so we have to manaully add the resource block for this

resource "aws_instance" "webserver"{
}

now rerun the import command it will run succesfully

now run the terraform apply command
it throw and error so
you have to modify the resource block and add the required arguments
