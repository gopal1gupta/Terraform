The terraform taint command informs Terraform that a particular object has become degraded or damaged.
Terraform represents this by marking the object as "tainted" in the Terraform state,
and Terraform will propose to replace it in the next plan you create

suppose someone changes the configuration from the console and if u run terraform plan then it will show tainted
you can untaint that so that it wont be created again
commands:
terraform taint aws_resource.name
terraform untaint aws_resource.name
